A Comprehensive Note Series on JavaScript Concepts and Practices
> These notes are based on the book *Eloquent JavaScript* by Marijn Haverbeke. The content summarized here covers key aspects of the history, evolution, and flexibility of JavaScript, including its introduction in 1995, the ECMAScript standard, and its uses beyond web browsers.

What is JavaScript?
---
JavaScript was introduced in 1995 to add interactivity to web pages in the Netscape Navigator browser and is now essential for modern web applications. Despite its name, it has little to do with Java. The language is governed by the **ECMAScript** standard, which ensures consistency across browsers. JavaScript's flexibility allows creative programming but can make debugging difficult. It has evolved through several versions: ECMAScript 3 (2000-2010), ECMAScript 5 (2009), ECMAScript 6 (2015), and regular updates since. It's used not only in browsers but also in platforms like Node.js and databases like MongoDB and CouchDB.

### **Values in JavaScript**

In JavaScript, values are chunks of information derived from bits, each with a specific type (e.g., numbers, text, or functions). Values are created effortlessly by invoking them, but they occupy memory. When no longer in use, their memory is recycled.
